# Full Stack Tech Blog Application

## Description
This web application provides the facility for viewing, creating and manipulating technical blog posts.

## Features
Users can view all posts written by themselves and other users.
They can create new categories of post, as well as new posts.
They can filter the post list by category.
They can update and delete (only) their own posts.

## Installation


#### **Clone the repository** and navigate to the codebase folder in a bash terminal
#### **Copy the `.env.example` file** and rename it to `.env`, then update the environment variables.
#### **Open MySQL and create the database:**
#### In a terminal type the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

#### In another terminal install the Node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

#### **Then seed the database with test data**

```bash
npm run seed
```

## Usage Instructions for Running on Your Local Machine

#### **Run the following command to start the application:**

```bash
npm start
```

#### **Visit the application in your browser:**

```browser
http://localhost:3001
```

## Mounting on Render

1. Create an account on [Render](https://render.com/).
2. Set up a **web service** for your **backend**.
3. Use **Render's MySQL database hosting** or an external MySQL provider.
4. Update your **database connection settings** in `.env` to match your MySQL provider.
5. Deploy your **front-end** (if separate) using **Render** or another hosting service.

## Technologies Used

Key technologies used are as follows:

#### Node.js
The back end of the web app is programmed in javaScript using Node.js

#### Express
Express is a commonly used and reliable backend framework used with Node.js for handling routes and middleware.

#### MySQL
MySQL is used as a platform for a stand-alone relational database. This database is used to store user, post and post category data.

#### Sequelize
Sequelize is used as a convenient interface between the javascript and the MySQL database. The data schemas are defined using sequelize "models".

#### Jason Web Tokens
This library handles the middleware authentication functionality.

## Folder Structure

### Code

The app code is found in the codebase folder. The subfolders of codebase are as follows:

#### config
This folder handles the setup of the connection between Sequelize and the MySQL database.
#### db
This folder details the setup of the MySQL database itself.
#### models
This folder defines the data models for all the data in the database (using sequelize format).
#### public
This folder defines the front end of the application.
#### routes
This folder defines all the back end routes.
#### utils
This folder contains the authentication middleware and secure signing functions.

### Files at codebase Top Level
Outside this subfolder structure are the following files:

#### .env
This file contains the database environment variables.

#### package.json
This file contains all the information needed for package management and app startup.

#### package-lock.json
This file is autogenerated from package.json.

#### server.js
This controls the running of the back end.

### Files Outside codebase
Outside of the codebase folder are the following items:

#### specification [folder]
This contains the original project challenge information.

#### .gitignore
This specifies which files and folders should not be monitored by the Git system.

#### readme.md
= this file
